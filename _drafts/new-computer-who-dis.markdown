I'm pretty sure it's mandatory for every technologist to have at least one blog post talking about their computer setup. I've been remiss so far but just got a new Microsoft Surface Book 3 and I'm going through the fun of setting up a new machine, so I figure this is a good time to remedy that. This is mostly a post for future Matt to help him more easily set up a machine, but will also talk about my desktop setup because why not?

## Surface Book 3
I've been recommending Surfaces to people for a while and finally decided it's time to bite the bullet and upgrade from a 2015 Macbook Pro running BootCamp to run Windows. That machine was super useful when I did mobile development, as Apple required (still requires? not sure) you have a Mac machine to develop for iOS. Since I no longer do that, dealing with dual boot was a minor hassle and I wanted more power in a newer machine. On top of that, the MacBook's cover is full of stickers and I need a new machine for new stickers!

### Windows Setup
Initial setup was pretty straightforward, but for the first time I let it sign in with my MicroSoft account and set up facial unlock. I of course turned off all privacy things in the setup flow. Once the machine finished setup, it was time to go through all settings and turn off even more privacy things (under security). Then I removed or uninstalled every widget from the Start Menu and collapsed it to minimal width. I also set darkmode, the correct timezone, turned off OneDrive (again, hopefully it stays off now), and uninstalled a lot of programs. Most uninstalled programs were the obvious, but a couple notable were Office for having 3 different versions installed + OneNote and Skype, which decided to sign me in without asking. I deleted Skype extra hard!
